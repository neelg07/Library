# Library
### Small-scale Library App Project from TOP

- The goal is to create a responsive app in JavaScript to add books into a virtual library
- The library will store multiple parameters per book, stored as objects.
- Will cement what was learned on JavaScript OOP, prototypal inheritance/chain, and object notation in both ES5 and ES6. 
- Also serves as a chance to get familiar with using the newly learned Node.js, nvm-windows, npm, packages such as ESLint, Prettier, and files such as .gitignore, package.json, etc.

- Project will focus on short-term functionality as of right now, with the incorporation of a storage system in the backend at a later date.
