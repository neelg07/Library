# Library
### Small-scale Library App Project from TOP

- The goal is to create a responsive app in JavaScript to add books into a virtual library
- The library will store multiple parameters per book, stored as objects.
- Will cement what was learned on JavaScript OOP, prototypal inheritance/chain, and object notation in both ES5 and ES6. 
- Also serves as a chance to get familiar with using the newly learned Node.js, nvm-windows, npm, packages such as ESLint, Prettier, and files such as .gitignore, package.json, etc.

- Project will focus on short-term functionality as of right now, with the incorporation of a storage system in the backend at a later date.

### Post-Project 

- Building this was more fun than many of the other projects and was a good enough of a challenge to develop my skills under some uncomfortability. 

- HTML concepts were pretty solid for this project with no pressing difficulties; Form and form validation is etched into memory pretty well, as well as using divs in grid/flexbox display to create layouts.

- CSS was tested and expanded upon a bit; implemented recently learned knowledge on using grid with auto-fit and minmax inside of repeat function to generate fluid/responsive grid for displaying the books in the library.

- Made use of ES6 classes and constructor methods to create instances of 'Book'. Also figured out the importance and accessibility of using setter functions rather than trying to change instance properties within functions outside of the global scope. 

- Learned about how to submit forms and return form data for use, without actually submitting the form to a server in the backend. FormData object was created to save data typed in the input fields and used to create book instances. 

- Many different functions were used in tandem to create one working program that created library cards with the info of each book object within.

- DOM Manipulation was used heavily in this project. Learned about the importance of returning items from inside of a function to get what you want, rather than relying on using 'side-effects' and other function calls inside of a function to get what you want. 

- Hardest part was adding event listeners to each individual card that effect only the corresponding book object it represents.
